Case01 - (octopus) This case is designed to see if the robot can navigate through multiple 
joined paths and find the end goal which is not far from the start. Also, the test 
is designed to place the goal to the left side of the Start position as this will 
the one of the last locations the robot will check (in order:up, right, down, left)

Case02 - (shortcut) This case has 2 paths that both lead to the goal and start from 
the same location but one is shorter than the other. This case is designed to see if 
the robot can choose the shortest path possible.

Case03 - (brickwall) Here the robot should run into 3 'brickwalls' where it will have 
to search for the last possible route which is the path to the goal. This is testing 
to see what happens if the robot encounters a node that has no continuing path.

Case04 - (meeting) Case04 is designed so that the 2 identical paths will meet at one 
point which will make the robot conclude there is only one path forward. This is used 
to test that the robot will continue the path after the 2 join.

Case05 - (outskirts) The final test case is to stress test how many nodes the system 
can read and use. It is also a good test of the reprinting of the map as there are so 
many updates to make.
